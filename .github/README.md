### 

The file at **.github/readme.md** appears to be _special_ readme, because its content (this file) appears on the repo root, and overrides the `README.md` in the repo's root.

I would expect the following to be the visible content, instead of this complaint/question.

See: [YesThatAllen/README.md](../README.md)
